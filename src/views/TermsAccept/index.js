                            </ol>
                            <p>9.1 The Foodcraft Platform enables Cooks to connect and provide Cook Services to Customers. There is no charge to register with us, to create a Foodcraft Account or to use the Foodcraft Platform. Foodcraft may charge a fee to Cooks for using Foodcraft Services ("<strong>Cook Fee</strong>"), which we may change from time to time and we may also charge Customers a fee for delivery on behalf of the Cook and if applicable to the Cook Services ("<strong>Delivery Fee</strong>") (collectively, "<strong>Service Fees</strong>") for the use of the Foodcraft Platform.</p>
                            <p>9.2 As compensation for the Cook, you understand that requesting the Cook Services on the Foodcraft Platform may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from a Cook (&ldquo;<strong>Charges</strong>&rdquo;). Each Cook is solely responsible for all costs involved with the Cook Services they offer, as the Foodcraft Platform enables Cooks to determine and set a per-portion price for each Listing ("<strong>Order Price</strong>"). Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by a Customer to a Cook. Any Cook Fee will be deducted from your Charges before remitting the payout to the Cook. Except as otherwise provided on the Foodcraft Platform (such as outlined in Refunds and Cancellation Policies), payment for the Charge and/or Service Fees are non-refundable.</p>
                            <p>9.3 The success of the Foodcraft community is reflected in the successes of the Cooks and as such, the range for the Cook Fee is calculated to fairly compensate Cooks using a variety of factors that may include the per-portion price, the order subtotal, number of orders, and other characteristics of the Foodcraft Order. By default, the Cook Fee is generally 15% of all sales revenue, however it may range between 0% and 20%. The Cook Fee is calculated from the order subtotal (the cost for the requested Cook Services, but excluding taxes, Stripe Fee, and the Delivery Fee if applicable) and is never more than $15.00 CAD for a single Foodcraft Order. In general, the Cook Fee lowers as the Foodcraft Order cost increases. The Cook Fee is automatically deducted from the payout to the Cook. Customers see the Delivery Fee on the checkout page before they request a Foodcraft Order.</p>
                            <p>9.4 This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Cooks for the services or goods provided. Foodcraft does not designate any portion of the Charges as a tip or gratuity to the Cook. After receiving the Cook Services obtained through the Foodcraft Platform, Customers will have the opportunity to rate the experience and leave feedback about the experience that can be viewed by other Members.</p>
                            <p>9.5 You are responsible for paying any Service Fees to Foodcraft. Any applicable Service Fees (including any applicable Taxes) will be displayed to a Cook or Customer prior to publishing a Listing or requesting a Foodcraft Order. Foodcraft reserves the right to change (or to temporarily change or waive) the Service Fees at any time, and will provide Members adequate notice, by using the email registered to the Foodcraft Account of each Member and be publicly displayed on the Foodcraft Platform, of any fee changes before they become effective.</p>
                            <p>9.6 <strong>You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any payment card(s) or other payment means used to pay any of the Charges. </strong>All payment information that you provide in connection with the Foodcraft Platform must be accurate, current and complete. By requesting any Foodcraft Order, you authorize your payment card to be charged in accordance with this Section. You will be responsible for paying any applicable taxes relating to your payments and will indemnify and hold harmless Foodcraft from any and all taxes, including sales tax, based on any payments made by you in connection with the Foodcraft Platform.</p>
                            <p>9.7 Foodcraft will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Cook as the Cook's limited payment collection agent, after which Foodcraft will send you a receipt by email. We use a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments from your use and payment for the Cook Services. Your use and collection of information is subject to the<a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">Stripe Privacy Policy</a> and the<a href="https://stripe.com/us/terms">Stripe Terms of Service</a>.</p>
