                    <h4>1.2 Information We Automatically Collect from Your Use of the Foodcraft Platform.</h4>
                    <p>When you use the Foodcraft Platform, we automatically collect information, including personal information, about the services you use and how you use them. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, to enable us to comply with legal obligations and given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the functionalities of the Foodcraft Platform.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Geo-location Information.</strong> When you use certain features of the Foodcraft Platform, we may collect information about your precise or approximate location as determined through data such as your IP address or mobile device’s GPS to offer you an improved user experience. Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable the use of location services for applications in the device’s settings menu. Foodcraft may also collect this information even when you are not using the app if this connection is enabled through your settings or device permissions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your interactions with the Foodcraft Platform such as the pages or content you view, your searches for Listings, orders you have made, and other actions on the Foodcraft Platform.</li>
                        <li><strong>Log Data and Device Information.</strong> We automatically collect log data and device information when you access and use the Foodcraft Platform, even if you have not created an Foodcraft Account or logged in. That information includes, among other things: details about how you’ve used the Foodcraft Platform (including if you clicked on links to third party applications), IP address, access dates and times, hardware and software information, device information, device event information, unique identifiers, crash data, cookie data, and the pages you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using the Foodcraft Platform.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong> We use cookies and other similar technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, and mobile identifiers. We may also allow our business partners to use these tracking technologies on the Foodcraft Platform, or engage others to track your behavior on our behalf. While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, the Foodcraft Platform currently does not respond to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application due to lack of standardization regarding how that signal should be interpreted.</li>
                        <li><strong>Payment Transaction Information.</strong> Foodcraft Payments collects information related to your payment transactions through the Foodcraft Platform, including the payment instrument used, date and time, payment amount, payment instrument expiration date and billing postcode, Stripe email address, IBAN information, your address and other related transaction details.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>1.3 Information We Collect from Third Parties.</h4>
                    <p>Foodcraft may collect information, including personal information, that others provide about you when they use the Foodcraft Platform, or obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Foodcraft Platform. We do not control, supervise or respond for how the third parties providing your information process your personal data, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third parties.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Third Party Services.</strong> If you link, connect, or login to your Foodcraft Account with a third party service (e.g. Google, Facebook, WeChat), the third party service may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service. This information varies and is controlled by that service or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your References.</strong> If someone has written a reference for you, it will be published on your Foodcraft public profile page with your consent. To learn more, see our Help Center article about References.</li>
                        <li><strong>Background Information.</strong> For Members in the United States, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, Foodcraft and Foodcraft Payments may obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations. For Members outside of the United States, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and with your consent where required, Foodcraft and Foodcraft Payments may obtain the local version of police, background or registered sex offender checks. We may use your information, including your full name and date of birth, to obtain such reports.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other Sources.</strong> To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data or fraud detection information, from third party service providers and/or partners, and combine it with information we have about you. For example, we may receive background check results (with your consent where required) or fraud warnings from service providers like identity verification services for our fraud prevention and risk assessment efforts. We may receive information about you and your activities on and off the Foodcraft Platform through partnerships, or about your experiences and interactions from our partner ad networks.</li>
