His parents were fabulous helping us with the fireplace, delivering fresh vegetables, showing us their garden areas and recanting the history of their family trullo. It was very difficult to leave after only 2 days; it was a peaceful, quiet country sojourn. The kitchen was great for cooking and we enjoyed drinking coffee in the morning sunshine on the patio, a washing machine was very useful as was the ring rack and finally we had great sleeps.",

The Trulli was very clean and the kitchen was conducive to cooking meals. It was great to have \"family room/kitchen table\" as a sitting area where we all hung out and played cards. His father was also very accessible the next day when we couldn't figure out how to use the washing machine and his wife came over to show us how. The fireplace was a bit difficult to use and did not give us consistent heat so we did find the place a bit cold. Also we did not realize that in the South many places are closed in Ciscternino and the surrounding area therefore 4 days in March was a bit long when we were finding things to do. Lastly, the two rooms were great for sleeping however only one of them was still in true \"Trulli\" fashion. It was a bit disappointing to the two of us who stayed in the plain ikea-like room. All in all a unique place to stay and we enjoyed our stay!",
